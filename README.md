# Documentation
(temporary?) Repo for Council documentation while the TEI website is in transition

Documents here have corresponding [CETEIcean](https://github.com/TEIC/CETEIcean) pages in the (TEIC GitHub Pages repo](https://github.com/TEIC/teic.github.io). Updates to these documents will be reflected (almost) immediately [there](http://teic.github.io/TCW/). If you add a new document here, you should add a corresponding HTML page that pulls it in there.
