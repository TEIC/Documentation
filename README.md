# Documentation
Repository for current TEI Technical Council documentation and working papers. 

The Official working papers archive is at: http://www.tei-c.org/activities/council/working/ which should contain links to these documents but also older non-current technical council working papers.

# Publication
Documents here have corresponding [CETEIcean](https://github.com/TEIC/CETEIcean) pages in the [TEIC GitHub Pages repo](https://github.com/TEIC/teic.github.io). Updates to these documents will be reflected (almost) immediately [there](http://teic.github.io/TCW/). If you add a new document here, you should add a corresponding HTML page that pulls it in there.
