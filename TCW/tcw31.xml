        <head>TEI Council: Update P5 subset</head>
        <div>
          <head>Rationale</head>
          <p>Many of the Stylesheets’ tests generate schemas from the
          TEI Guidelines (using customization ODD files). This means
          that the test process needs to have access to a copy of
          P5. This in itself is not a particularly big problem — after
          all, there is always a copy available at <ptr
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/P5/current/xml/tei/odd/p5subset.xml"/>.
          But the way many of these tests work is to compare the
          schema generated by the test process with the expected
          schema: if they are the same, the test succeeds, if there
          is a difference, the test fails.</p>
          <p>On the face of it, this seems a sensible way to test. If
          you have changed the Stylesheets, you want to make sure your
          changes have not altered the generated schemas, at least not
          in a manner you did not expect. But this means there is an
          brittle dependency between the Guidelines and the
          Stylesheets’ test process, which itself is quite
          fragile.</p>
          <div>
            <head>Dependency</head>
            <p>To understand the dependency problem, imagine that
            shortly after the release of P5 version 629.514.13 we drop
            the <gi>datatype</gi> element from the ODD language: the
            possible value(s) of an attribute are expressed with a
            <gi>dataRef</gi> rather than a <gi>dataRef</gi> inside a
            <gi>datatype</gi>. (This means that <gi>dataRef</gi> would
            need to become a member of <name
            type="class">att.repeatable</name>.) Once we change the
            Guidelines so that <gi>datatype</gi> is not an element, we
            need to actually remove <gi>datatype</gi> from the
            Guidelines, so that they remain valid.</p>
            <p>After these changes, we change the Stylesheets so that
            they know how to handle a <gi>dataRef</gi>, possibly with
            <att>minOccurs</att> or <att>maxOccurs</att>, that is a
            direct child of <gi>attDef</gi>. If we try to test the
            Stylesheets against P5 v. 629.514.13 (or any previous
            version) there will definitionally be no cases of a
            <gi>dataRef</gi> without <gi>datatype</gi> in the base
            ODD, because in that version of the Guidelines a
            <gi>dataRef</gi> was <emph>required</emph> to be inside a
            <gi>datatype</gi>. So (as long as we did not remove the
            code that handles a <gi>dataRef</gi> inside a
            <gi>datatype</gi>) the Stylesheets tests may not fail, but
            neither will they exercise our new code, that which we
            most need to test.</p>
            <p>So we need to tell the Stylesheets to use the new
            version of the Guidelines (v. 629.515.0α) as the base
            ODD. The way we do this is just to put a copy of the new
            version of the Guidelines into the Stylesheets repository.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <head>Fragility</head>
            <p>Because the test procedure involves comparing two
            schemas (the actual output generated by the test, and the
            output that is expected from the test) using a string
            comparison tool, even very minor changes to the
            Guidelines may cause a test to fail. In fact, because the
            glosses and descriptions of XML constructs are included in
            the output schemas (so that tools like oXygen can make use
            of them), there are revisions that do not change the actual
            XML defined by the schema, but nonetheless will cause a
            test to fail.</p>
            <p><label>Example 1</label> If the description of the
            <gi>constraint</gi> element were corrected from <quote>the
            formal rules of a constraint</quote> to <quote>contains
            the formal rules of a constraint.</quote>, every test that
            involves creating a schema that contains the
            <gi>constraint</gi> element would fail.</p>
            <p><label>Example 2</label> If the content model of the
            <gi>foo</gi> element were simplified from
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <sequence>
                <elementRef key="bar"/>
                <elementRef key="bar"/>
                <elementRef key="bar" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
              </sequence>
            </egXML>
            to just
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <elementRef key="bar" minOccurs="2" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
            </egXML>
            the same set of documents (those that have two or more
            <gi>bar</gi> elements as children of each <gi>foo</gi>)
            would be valid against the new schema. But since the
            actual grammar is different — it now has <code>bar,
            bar+</code> where it used to have <code>bar, bar,
            bar*</code>, the test would fail.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Solution</head>
          <p>Since the Stylesheets are tested against a specific
          version of the Guidelines, it is very helpful to have a
          (more or less) up-to-date copy of the Guidelines in the
          Stylesheet repository. If nothing else, this minimizes the
          possibility of testing with the wrong version of P5.</p>
          <p>Thus we store a copy of the Guidelines in a file called
          <name type="file">p5subset.xml</name> in the
          <code>source/</code> directory. Just building the Guidelines
          in the TEI repository does <hi rend="italics">not</hi> put a
          new copy of p5subset.xml into the
          <code>Stylesheets/source/</code> directory. The file needs
          to be manually copied over, hence these instructions for
          doing so. This task is typically performed at least monthly
          by a Council member.</p>

              (Remember that a lot of what the Makefile does is transform a test file using the
              Stylesheets and then compare the actual output of that command to a file which
              contains the expected output of that command. These comparisons are done using the
                <code>diff</code> command.) If you ask it nicely, the <code>make</code> command will
              just generate the outputs, and defer the actual testing of them (by diffing them with
              the corresponding expected output). This means that running <code>make</code> is
              dramatically faster, but it does not do all the work, you have to do some of it. To do

                  been executed is preceded with “<code>==</code>” at the beginning of the line (and

            <head>Faster testing</head>
            <p><hi rend="bold">Note:</hi> Recommendations by Syd Bauman. One of the reasons the test
              procedure in <code>Stylesheets/Test2/</code> is dramatically faster than the one in
                <code>Stylesheets/Test/</code> is that it is, by default, run in parallel.<note
                n="1"><code>ant test</code>​ runs them in parallel; if you want them in series
                (likely because the order of messages was confusing when run in parallel) use
                  <code>ant testSeries​</code>.</note><note n="2">There are other reasons, like it
                is written to be less redundant, and the JVM is only spun up once, rather than once
                for every test.</note></p>
            <p>You can also ask the <code>make​</code> command to run multiple jobs at once. The
              switches that control this are <code>--jobs=</code> and <code>--output-sync=.</code> I
              just tried an experiment, comparing how long it took to run <code>make​</code> vs
                <code>make --jobs=7 --output-sync=lines</code>. (I chose 7 because my system has 8
              threads, and I wanted to have some CPU available. What little I have found on the web
              seems to suggest I may as well go ahead and use 8.)</p>
            <p>The result was faster, although not even close to 7 times faster: down to 03:32 from
              04:36. I compared the output of the 2 commands, and they were identical.</p>
            <p>On GNU/Linux, at least, the <code>nproc</code>​ command will tell you how many
              threads are available. Thus using the command <lb/><code>$ make --jobs=`nproc
                2>/dev/null || echo 1` -Oline</code>
              <lb/>seems to make sense to me. (<code>-O</code> is shorthand for
                <code>--output-sync=​.</code>)</p>
            <p>It is also possible to get the Makefile to do that on its own. My first thought is
              that might not be such a good idea, because you may want to run with
                <code>--jobs=1</code> in order to force error messages into the right order. (I.e.,
              in case <code>-Oline</code> wasn’t good enough.)</p>
            <p>I ran the experiment again, this time using <code>--jobs=8</code> and getting screen
              captures of the process monitor roughly 40 s after the make command started.<note
                n="3">For evidence as to why the <code>--jobs</code> switch expedites the
                  <code>make​</code> process, see <ref
                  target="https://bauman.zapto.org/~syd/temp/4TEICouncil/Screenshot_of_make_process_monitor_2022-04-05T12:07:52.png"

              </note> The timing results were very similar (down to 03:36 from 04:36), but the order
              of output lines was different. (Same output; i.e., they were identical after sorting
              and removing timestamps.)</p>
            <p>So I think anyone running the Stylesheets test process would do well to use the
                <code>--jobs</code> switch. You could use any of <lb/><eg> <code>-j 8 #</code> if you know you
                have 8 threads, e.g. <lb/> <code>--jobs=`nproc` #</code> if you know the <code>nproc</code> command works on

          <p>This signals that a dependency is missing or corrupted. In our example, fop-2.6 is a
            directory generated by <code>ant</code> while it is running a jar dependency. Perhaps a
            network connection was interrupted somehow or the process didn't complete as it was
            supposed to do. The simplest way to correct this is to delete the fop-2.6 directory, and
            return to <code>Test2</code> and run “<code>ant test</code>” again. This lets
              <code>ant</code> pull in a clean copy of the missing dependency.</p>
