        <head>TEI Council: Update P5 subset</head>
        <head>Rationale</head>
        <p>The Stylesheets tests can succeed only against either the release branch of P5, or the dev branch of P5, but often not against both simultaneously. For instance, the Stylesheets dev branch sometimes successfully builds against P5 release, but fails against P5 dev branch. On release day, we need the Stylesheets release branch to build against P5 release branch successfully i.e. we need the tests to work with the release branch against the release branch without producing any errors.</p>
        <p>Changes on either side (Stylesheets or Guidelines) may break either build. The Stylesheets test procedure in particular is quite fragile, and if it fails, the build fails. For instance, since the contents of <gi>desc</gi> elements are copied over into schemas, even a small change (like adding a comma) to an element description in the Guidelines might break the Stylesheets build.
        </p>
        <p>Since the Stylesheets are built against the Guidelines, there needs to be a (more or less) up-to-date copy of the Guidelines in the Stylesheet repository. This copy of the Guidelines is a file called “p5subset.xml” and it is stored in the <code>source/</code> directory. Building the Guidelines in the TEI repository does <hi rend="italics">not</hi> put a new copy of p5subset.xml into the <code>Stylesheets/source/</code> directory. In order to keep the version of the p5subset.xml in the Stylesheets repository up to date, that file is updated monthly by Council members.
          </p>

            <item n="2.2.3">Update the version of the p5subset.xml in the <code>Stylesheets/source/</code> directory in the Stylesheets dev branch: 
              <lb/><code>cp -p [relative path to TEIC/TEI/ directory]/P5/p5subset.xml source/p5subset.xml</code>. 
              <lb/>For example, if you have the <code>TEIC/TEI</code> repo in <code>~/TEICouncil/repos/TEI/</code> and the <code>TEIC/Stylesheets</code> repo in <code>~/TEICouncil/repos/Stylesheets/</code>,
              you would issue:

            <item n="4">If there are no errors from the <code>Test2</code> process, proceed to the <code>Test/</code> process outlined in steps 5 and 6. If there are errors from the <code>Test2</code> process, complete steps 4.1 to 4.6: <list>
                <item n="4.1">The vast majority of all errors from <code>Test2</code> will be “diff errors”, i.e. a difference between a file generated from processing with the new p5subset (in the
                    <code>Test2/outputFiles/</code> directory) and the corresponding file that had
                  previously been generated from processing with the old p5subset (in the
                    <code>expected-results/</code> directory).</item>
                <item n="4.2">If the process stops with an error that is not a diff error, notice whether
                  it's due to something failing to load that the testing process requires. If that's
                  the case, read the error message carefully and see if you can figure out what's
                  failing (and reach out to Council members for help). See the <ref
                    target="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</ref> section, below for an example failure of the <code>ant</code> process and a simple fix.</item>
                <item n="4.3"><p>In the case of a diff error, examine the differences generated. If the
                    differences are what you would expect given the change in P5 (which is by far
                    the most common case), just copy the output file to be the new expected results
                    file. For example, if one of the changes made to P5 was to add an English gloss
                    for <gi>mentioned</gi>, a diff error would be entirely expected. It would look
                    like

                  </p>
                  <p>You can quickly look at the differences (“(mentioned)” was
                    inserted), and realize that is an appropriate change. So to fix this error you
                    just copy the actual output file to be the new expected file. <hi rend="bold">Note:</hi> The 2nd line of the output is specifically designed to make executing the desired copy
                    command easy. (You can copy everything after the “<code>=</code>”, type
                      “<code>cp -p</code>” on the command line and then paste in the paths you just copied: <lb/><code>$ cp -p [path]/Test2/outputFiles/testPure1.rng [path]/Test2/expected-results/testPure1.rng</code> 
                    <lb/>The “<code>-p</code>” switch is optional — it just gives the copy the same
                    timestamp and permissions as the original.)</p>

                <item n="4.4">If the error is either a diff error you would not have expected, or worse a
                  different kind of error completely, fix it. <hi rend="bold">Note:</hi> Fixing the error might be trivially easy or might take weeks of work from half a dozen different people.

              file using the Stylesheets and then compare the actual output of that command to a
              file which contains the expected output of that command. These comparisons are done
              using the <code>diff</code> command.) If you ask it nicely, the <code>make</code> command will just generate the
              outputs, and defer the actual testing of them (by diffing them with the corresponding
              expected output). This means that running <code>make</code> is dramatically faster, but it does not
              do all the work, you have to do some of it. To do this: <list>
                <item n="6.1">Make sure you are in the <code>Test/</code> directory.</item>
                <item n="6.2">run <code>$ time make DIFFNOW=0</code>
                  <lb/>or, if you want to try to use multiple threads, run: <lb/><code>$ time make DIFFNOW=0
                    --jobs=`nproc 2>/dev/null || echo 1` -Oline</code></item>
                <item n="6.3">To see the actual filenames being diffed, add the “<code>-C0</code>” switch:
                    <lb/><code>make DIFFNOW=0 -C0</code></item>
                <item n="6.4">When the Makefile has run a transformation, instead of comparing the actual
                  output of that transformation to the expected output, it will say something like
                    “<code>==deferring: ` diff actual-results/test27.html
                    expected-results/test27.html `</code>”.</item>
                <item n="6.5">Once the <code>make</code> command is complete, you now need to perform all those
                  comparisons yourself. Luckily, this is designed to be relatively easy. E.g., each
                  message that reports a <code>diff</code> command that has not been executed is preceded with
                  “<code>==</code>” at the beginning of the line (and no other output from the Makefile starts with “<code>==</code>” at the beginning of the line).</item>
                <item n="6.6">Copy the output from the <code>make DIFFNOW=0</code> command into your favorite text editor.</item>
                <item n="6.7">Delete all lines that <emph>do not</emph> start with “<code>==</code>”.</item>
                <item n="6.8">Remove the “<code>==deferring: `</code>” from the beginning of each
                  line.</item>
                <item n="6.9">Remove the “<code>`</code>” from the end of each line.</item>
                <item n="6.10">Insert “<code>#! /bin/bash</code>” as a 1st line.</item>
                <item n="6.11">Save this file as <code>diffnow_erase_me_soon.bash</code> or choose an equally recognisable filename so you can easily find and delete it once finished.</item>
                <item n="6.12">Change the mode of this new file to be executable (i.e., <code>chmod a+x diffnow_erase_me_soon.bash</code>).</item>
                <item n="6.13">Run it (i.e. <code>./diffnow_erase_me_soon.bash</code>).</item>
              </list></item>
            <item n="7">If <code>Test/</code> is successful (returns zero mis-matches) or if you have fixed all the mis-matches manually following step 6, commit the change with the following command: <lb/><code>git commit -a -m “update p5 subset”</code>
            </item>
            <item n="8">A prompt to add any untracked files to the commit will be generated. Ignore the prompt to add the untracked files to the commit. Push the commit to dev with the command: <code>git push</code>

              <p>Following step 5, each actual result is generated in turn and compared to the expected result. The first time there is a mis-match, the whole process fails. You need to fix the mis-match and start again from step 5.2.</p>
            <p>Following step 6, all actual results are generated first, and then compared to the expected results afterwards. Thus the make process does not fail for a mis-match, but you have to manually find and fix the mis-matches on your own.</p>
            <p>If there are only a very few mis-matches, step 5 is the better way to go.

          <head>Faster testing</head>
          <p><hi rend="bold">Note:</hi> Recommendations by Syd Bauman. One of the reasons the test procedure in <code>Stylesheets/Test2/</code> is
            dramatically faster than the one in <code>Stylesheets/Test/</code> is that it is, by
            default, run in parallel.<note n="1"><code>ant test</code>​ runs them in parallel; if
              you want them in series (likely because the order of messages was confusing when run
              in parallel) use <code>ant testSeries​</code>.</note><note n="2">There are other
              reasons, like it is written to be less redundant, and the JVM is only spun up once,
              rather than once for every test.</note></p>
          <p>You can also ask the <code>make​</code> command to run multiple jobs at once. The switches that
            control this are <code>--jobs=</code> and <code>--output-sync=.</code> I just tried an
            experiment, comparing how long it took to run <code>make​</code> vs <code>make --jobs=7 --output-sync=lines</code>. (I chose 7 because my system has 8 threads, and I wanted
            to have some CPU available. What little I have found on the web seems to suggest I may
            as well go ahead and use 8.)</p>
          <p>The result was faster, although not even close to 7 times faster: down to 03:32 from
            04:36. I compared the output of the 2 commands, and they were identical.</p>
          <p>On GNU/Linux, at least, the <code>nproc</code>​ command will tell you how many threads are available. Thus using the command 
            <lb/><code>$ make --jobs=`nproc 2>/dev/null || echo 1` -Oline</code>
            <lb/>seems to make sense to me. (<code>-O</code> is shorthand for <code>--output-sync=​.</code>)</p>
          <p>It is also possible to get the Makefile to do that on its own. My first thought is that
            might not be such a good idea, because you may want to run with <code>--jobs=1</code> in order to force error messages into the right order. (I.e., in case <code>-Oline</code>
            wasn’t good enough.)</p>
          <p>I ran the experiment again, this time using <code>--jobs=8</code> and getting screen
            captures of the process monitor roughly 40 s after the make command started.<note n="3">For evidence as to why the <code>--jobs</code> switch expedites the <code>make​</code> process, see 	<ref target="https://bauman.zapto.org/~syd/temp/4TEICouncil/Screenshot_of_make_process_monitor_2022-04-05T12:07:52.png">Screenshot_of_make_process_monitor_2022-04-05T12:07:52.png</ref> and 	<ref target="https://bauman.zapto.org/~syd/temp/4TEICouncil/Screenshot_of_make_-j_process_monitor_2022-04-05T12:12:32.png">Screenshot_of_make_-j_process_monitor_2022-04-05T12:12:32.png</ref>
            </note> The timing
            results were very similar (down to 03:36 from 04:36), but the order of output lines was
            different. (Same output; i.e., they were identical after sorting and removing
            timestamps.)</p>
          <p>So I think anyone running the Stylesheets test process would do well to use the
              <code>--jobs</code> switch. You could use any of 
            <lb/><eg> -j 8 # if you know you have 8 threads, e.g.
              <lb/> --jobs=`nproc` # if you know the nproc command works on your
              system
              <lb/> -j `nproc 2> /dev/null || echo 1​` # if there is a chance nproc
              fails,<lb/> # so it defaults to '1' </eg>
          </p>

          <head>Troubleshooting</head>
          <p>Test 2: What if the <code>ant</code> process fails because some necessary dependency is missing? For example, you may see an error message like this:<lb/>
            <eg>A class needed by class org.apache.fop.tools.anttasks.Fop cannot be found:<lb/>
              org/apache/commons/logging/Log using the classloader<lb/>
              AntClassLoader[/YOUR/FILEPATH/TO/TEIC/Stylesheets/lib/fop-2.6/fop/lib/jeuclid-core-3.1.9.jar:/YOUR/FILEPATH/TO/TEIC/Stylesheets/lib/fop-2.6/fop/lib/jeuclid-fop-3.1.9.jar:/Users/eeb4/Documents/GitHub/TEIC/Stylesheets/lib/fop-2.6/fop/build/fop-hyph.jar:/Users/eeb4/Documents/GitHub/TEIC/Stylesheets/lib/fop-2.6/fop/build/fop.jar</eg></p>
          <p>This signals that a dependency is missing or corrupted. In our example, fop-2.6 is a directory generated by <code>ant</code> while it is running a jar dependency. Perhaps a network connection was interrupted somehow or the process didn't complete as it was supposed to do. The simplest way to correct this is to delete the fop-2.6 directory, and return to <code>Test2</code> and run “<code>ant test</code>” again. This lets <code>ant</code> pull in a clean copy of the missing dependency.</p>
