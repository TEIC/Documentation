      <body>
            <p>At its April 2013 face-to-face meeting in Providence, the Technical Council agreed to
               the following policy for handling practices that are "no longer recommended" or
               "deprecated".</p>

            <div>
               <head>No longer recommended</head>

               <p>While the TEI Guidelines often offer more than one way of encoding a particular
                  phenomenon, in this case the Council agrees to identify a preferred method without
                  making any definite plans to remove the non-preferred way from the Guidelines. In
                  this case:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>The <gi>remarks</gi> element is used in the spec to indicate the preferred
                     practice.</item>
                  <item>The prose in one or more chapters is revised to indicate this preferred
                     practice. Examples showing the non-preferred practice are maintained but
                     preferably only in the section of the Guidelines where that element or
                     attribute is discussed, not in passing elsewhere.</item>
               </list>
            </div>
            
            <div>
               <head>Deprecated</head>
               
               <p>Following  the <ref target="tcw09.xml">Birnbaum doctrine</ref>, the Council has made the serious decision to
                  break backwards compatibility by changing the content model of an element or class
                  to remove an element or attribute, or to remove an element or attribute entirely
                  from the Guidelines. In this case:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>The appropriate spec is modified to add <att>validUntil</att> on the appropriate
                        <gi>elementSpec</gi>, <gi>classRef</gi>, or <gi>attDef</gi> elements. The
                     value of <att>validUntil</att> shall be no sooner than two years from the date of the
                     change (thus guaranteeing <emph>at least</emph> one year from the release in which the
                     deprecation is announced to the change in which the feature disappears).</item>
                  <item>An announcement is sent to TEI-L that the Technical Council has decided to 
                     depreacate elementName and will drop it as early as YYYY-MM-DD. If anyone strongly objects, 
                     they should reply to the list so that the Council might reconsider.</item>
                  <item>Any examples of the deprecated practice are removed from the Guidelines, and
                     any prose recommending them is reworded as appropriate.</item>
                  <item>We will try to remember to include a mention of the deprecation in the
                     release notes created for the following release.</item>
               </list>
               
               <p>After the date specified in <att>validUntil</att>:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>The element or attribute is actually removed from the spec.</item>
               </list>
            </div>
      </body>
   </text>
</TEI>
