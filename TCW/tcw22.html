      <tei-p data-teiname="p">This document aims to provide a set of detailed instructions enabling a "release
        technician" (the Council member tasked with implementing a new release of the TEI) to
        prepare for and manage the release process. It assumes that the new packages will be taken
        from one of the Jenkins servers rather than being built locally by the release technician.
        This is easier and more reliable, because we ensure that the Jenkins servers are regularly
        updated and are correctly configured to build the TEI products.</tei-p>

            repository causes them to start building TEI packages. There are three specific build
            jobs associated with P5, and they run in a fixed sequence. Currently, as of February 2020,
            the actual build for the release will rely on the first Jenkins server, often referred to as

            This should be the final push for this version, and it will trigger the Jenkins servers

            And now you wait while the Jenkins servers build the packages, keeping in mind that
            subsequent steps will require the build packages from the Paderborn Jenkins server 
            (as of February 2020). This can take a couple of hours, so be patient.

              "All of the Jenkins servers should behave

            <tei-hi data-teiname="hi" rend="bold">Note</tei-hi>: The P5 and Stylesheets builds have reciprocal dependencies,
            so the first build of either the Stylesheets or the Guidelines may fail just because
            there isn't yet a current build of the other for it to use. This isn't a cause for
            panic, but it may mean that (e.g.) the Stylesheets build needs to run twice. In particular,
	    the Stylesheets build may fail after the TEI release is complete, so it is better to wait
	    until the TEI release is complete before doing the Stylesheets release. (Council is considering

            Recalling how release preparation requires confirmation of version number,
            use your best judgment to determine the version number for the next release (in consultation with Council,
            if possible). TEI version numbers are based on the Unicode Consortium system (<tei-ref data-teiname="ref" target="http://www.unicode.org/versions/">http://www.unicode.org/versions/</tei-ref>) but with the first
            digit for major changes, the second for schema-changing revisions, and the third for
            non-schema-changing revisions. When the first or second digit is incremented, the
            following digit or digits is set to zero. 
            
            <!-- Revisit version control instructions at May 2020 F2F (JL, 2020-02-13) -->
            
            After the release process has been completed, the release number for both P5 and the
            Stylesheets needs to be updated. On the dev branch, edit the P5/VERSION file and the Stylesheets/VERSION
            file to the correct numbers. These files contain nothing except the bare version number. 
            It should be incremented appropriately, and "a" added to the end of it, so if for example 
            the release was number 2.8.0, you would change the number in the file to:<tei-lb data-teiname="lb"></tei-lb>
            <tei-code data-teiname="code">2.9.0a</tei-code><tei-lb data-teiname="lb"></tei-lb> signifying that the versions built subsequent to the release
            are now in the alpha stage. </tei-item>
