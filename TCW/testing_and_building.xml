        <head>How to build and test the Guidelines and Stylesheets</head>
        <p>Getting set up to run the various building and testing targets in the Guidelines and
          Stylesheets is relatively easy in Debian Linuxes like Ubuntu. But it is quite tricky on
          other systems, like Mac OS X or Windows. The TEI Jenkins server will run a variety of
          builds when you push changes to the TEI or Stylesheets repos, but you may find you prefer
          to run the tests locally, as they will likely be faster and will save you the trouble of
          waiting for Jenkins to email you when it finds a problem. Moreover, if you’re doing work
          in a branch, Jenkins won't help you at all, and it can be very useful to “check your work”
          as you go to avoid lots of bug-fixing when your merge back into dev.</p>
        <p>The first step in setting up your development and testing environment is to get copies of
          the TEI and Stylesheets repositories. These can be obtained from <ptr
            target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI"/> and <ptr
            target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets"/> respectively. All of the following
          instructions assume you are at least somewhat comfortable working in a command line
          environment. If you aren’t, this would be a good time to learn. A rather Mac-biased
          tutorial may be found at “<ref target="https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial"
            >Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous</ref>”, while Windows 10 users may learn how
          to install a Bash shell and the basics of using it at “<ref
            target="http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/"
            >How to Install and Use the Linux Bash Shell on Windows 10</ref>”. Once you're in a
          terminal window, you can clone the TEI repos thus: 
          <lb/><code>git clone git@github.com:TEIC/TEI.git</code> and 
          <lb/><code>git clone git@github.com:TEIC/Stylesheets.git</code>
        </p>
        <p>It's probably a good idea to keep these side-by-side. I put mine in a directory called:
            <code>/Users/hcayless/Development/TEIC</code>. As you will see, it’s a good idea to do
          this somewhere under the Users directory, whether you’re on Mac or Windows. If you’re
          running Ubuntu or some other Linux, you can put them where you like. Let’s assume you’ve
          got working copies of the TEI and Stylesheets repos, and that you’ve made some changes
          you’d like to test before you push them back up to GitHub and make them available to
          everyone. The TEI has set up a pre-built test environment in Docker that you can use.
          First, you should get Docker. On a Mac, go to <ptr
            target="https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/mac"/>, on Windows, <ptr
            target="https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/windows"/>, and on Linux, <ptr
            target="https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/linux"/>. Once you have docker
          installed, you can run <lb/><code>docker pull teic/teidev-docker</code>
          <lb/>to grab a copy of the pre-built image.</p>
        <p>Now you’re ready to run your test environment. You'll need a couple of pieces of
          information for Docker: the location of your repositories and your timezone. Your timezone
          can be looked up on <ref
            target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones">Wikipedia</ref>.
          You need it because the default timezone of the container is UTC, which will lead to
          strange warnings when you run the builds unless you actually happen to be in sync with
          UTC, because the local time of your computer will differ from that set in the container.
          The directory containing your repositories will be mapped to a directory in the container
          (which is why it's easier to put them side-by-side). You'll run the test container with a
          command like: 
          <lb/><code>docker run -v /Users/hcayless/Development/TEIC:/tei -it -e TZ=America/New_York teic/teidev-docker /bin/bash</code>
          <lb/>Which will put you in a Bash shell inside the container, at the root directory. If
          you do <code>cd tei</code> and then <code>ls</code>, you should see the repos you cloned
          above. There's one more piece of work to be done, and that's to tell the Guidelines build
          process where it can find your copy of the Stylesheets. You do that by adding a
            <code>local.mk</code> file in <code>TEI/P5</code>. So, (from <code>/tei</code>) do
            <code>cd TEI/P5</code> and then <code>echo "XSL=/tei/Stylesheets" > local.mk</code>. Now
          you can build things! And, what's more, you can work on the Guidelines and Stylesheets in
          your regular environment, and test them in Docker.</p>
        <p>To build the HTML version of the Guidelines, for example, you can run (in
            <code>/tei/TEI/P5</code>) <code>make html-web</code>, and after the process finishes,
          you'll have a directory called “Guidelines-web” in your P5 directory. Outside your Docker
          shell, you can browse to this folder, find the index.html file, and open it in a browser.
          “Make” is a program typically used for compiling programs, but it's also very useful as a 
          kind of generic batch scripting tool, which is how it's being used here. In the
          Guidelines, you'll typically want to run make inside the <code>P5/</code> directory and in
          the Stylesheets, you'll want to run it at the top of the repo (in
          <code>Stylesheets/</code>. You can also run Make in any directory that contains a
          <code>Makefile</code>. Note that the targets may vary. Running <code>make</code> inside
          <code>Stylesheets/Test</code> is pretty much the same as running <code>make test</code> on
          level up. You can also run individual test targets if, e.g., there's a particular set of
          tests you want to troubleshoot. The targets are all defined in the
          <code>Makefile</code>s.</p>
        <p>The <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/get.xml">Using the TEI GitHub
          Repository</ref> document has more detail on all the processes you can run, and very
          meager information on how to get set up to run them—but you just bypassed all that.
          Besides the <code>make</code> targets listed there, both the TEI and Stylesheets repos
          have <code>make test</code> targets which get run by Jenkins when you push to GitHub.
          These are both good ways to check your code before pushing. Make does lots of things when
          you run any of these targets, but all of them should finish with a “BUILD SUCCESSFUL”
          message. If there's a problem, you'll get a failure message, hopefully with some
          indication of what went wrong. If you've run a build target, you probably want to run a
            <code>make clean</code> before doing it again to make sure files that were generated
          during the last run don't interfere with your next build (Make tries not to repeat itself,
          so if it finds existing build artifacts, it won't rebuild them). Targets can be put
          together, so you can do <code>make clean test</code>, and it will clean things up before
          running the test target.</p>
