# This is a (probably temporary) additional CSS file for use with TCW
# 32. Created because I want TCW 32 output to look better, but do not
# know without a lot of work what effect these changes would have on
# our various other outputs if added to the main CSS. So I am tucking
# them in here and inserting them in my output using the
# $cssInlineFiles parameter. â€”Syd, 2022-01-13
