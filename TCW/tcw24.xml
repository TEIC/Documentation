  <text>
    <body>
      <p>This document aims to capture decisions about House Style for writing and editing the TEI
        Guidelines, in order to maintain consistency throughout the Guidelines.</p>
      <div xml:id="house-style-tone-and-voice">
        <head>Tone and voice</head>
        <p>The Guidelines are a reference manual, not a tutorial. You should not talk down to the
          reader, but assume they have a reasonably well-informed knowledge of the subjects under
          discussion. Make copious use of cross references, rather than repetition.</p>
        <p>Bear in mind however that your reader may not have English as their first language. Avoid
          needlessly complex sentences and unnecessarily obscure terminology.</p>
        <p>Choose clarity and concision over adherence to any particular voice. However, you should
          be careful in your use of the first person, avoiding the implication that a community of
          scholars, or the whole TEI community, takes a certain view. The use of "we" is appropriate
          in passages of formal textual exposition, where "we" refers to both the reader and the
          authorial voice. For instance: "Each chapter of the Guidelines presents a group of related
          elements, and also defines a corresponding set of declarations, which we call a
          module."</p>
        <p>Avoid the use of a first-person authorial voice that does not include the reader as part
          of "we." For instance: "We do not describe them in detail here," which refers to a
          particular editorial decision made by the authors of the Guidelines. In this case, "They
          are not described in detail here" is preferred.</p>
        <p>As a test, ask yourself whether the material being asserted, typically a technical term
          or usage, is something the reader is expected to internalize and use themselves
          thereafter. If so, use "we." If not, it is more appropriate to use the passive voice.</p>
        <p>In general, avoid imperative constructions ("you should..."). However, key words like 
          "should", "must", "must not", "recommended", etc. should be used in accordance with 
          <ref target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14">BCP 14</ref>.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div xml:id="house-style-usage">
        <head>General notes on usage</head>
        <p>This is a list of notes on usage preferences and conventions, which we expect to expand
          over time.</p>
        <list type="gloss">
          <label>Gender-neutral pronouns</label>
          <item>We prefer the usage "they", "their" etc. where the third person singular is
            required, but gender is unspecified. For instance: "The encoder may follow their own
            preference here." This is less ungainly than "his/her" etc. </item>
          <label>Technical terms</label>
          <item>Make sure that technical terms are glossed on their first appearance. For instance,
            XML-related terminology should be introduced in the chapter on XML. If you want to
            provide other references, do so as footnotes, using the <gi>note</gi> element.</item>
          <label>References</label>
          <item>Provide bibliographic citations for any other standards (etc) referenced, following
            the existing style. Do not introduce bibliographic citations simply in order to
            demonstrate your learning. </item>
          <label>Descriptions in specifications</label>
          <item>The description of an element, attribute, model class, or attribute class contained in 
            <gi>desc</gi> should always be a verbal phrase beginning with a present-tense verb 
            ("contains a ...", "groups together ...", etc.)</item>
        </list>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="house-style-naming-conventions">
        <head>Naming conventions</head>
        <p>TEI naming conventions have evolved over time, but remain fairly consistent. </p>
        <list type="gloss">
          <label>generic identifiers</label>
          <item>Element and attribute identifiers should be a single natural language word in
            lowercase if possible. For instance: <gi>bibl</gi>. If more than one word is conjoined
            to form a name, then the first letter of the second and any subsequent word should be
            uppercased. For instance: <gi>biblStruct</gi>. Hyphens, underscores, dots etc are not
            used within element or attribute names. </item>
          <label>class names</label>
          <item>Class names are made up three parts: a name, constructed like an element name, with
            a prefix and optionally a suffix. The prefix is one of <code>model.</code> or
            <code>att.</code> and indicates whether this is a model or an attribute class. The
            suffix, if present, is used to indicate subclassing. For example
            <ident>att.linking.foo</ident> is the <ident>foo</ident> subclass of the attribute
            class <ident>att.linking</ident></item>
          <label>xml:id values</label>
          <item>The conventions for these vary somewhat. Most of the older chapters of the
            guidelines have consistently constructed identifiers, derived from the individual
            section headings. Identifiers must be provided for:- <list>
              <item>every <gi>div</gi>, whether or not it is explicitly linked to elsewhere</item>
              <item>every bibliographic reference in the <ident>BIB.xml</ident> file</item>
            </list></item>
        </list>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="house-style-capitalization">
        <head>Capitalization of headings</head>
        <p>Use title case as defined in the <title level="m">Chicago Manual of Style</title> for 
          all headings (i.e. all text in <gi>head</gi> elements that occur as children of <gi>div</gi>
          elements). </p>
        
      </div>
      
      <div xml:id="house-style-orthography">
        <head>Preferred orthography</head>
        <p>The goal of these rules is to avoid inconsistency, and also (wherever possible) to avoid
          producing text which is markedly either British or American English. For example, use the 
          "-ize" suffix instead of "-ise" for words that are a Latinized version of a Greek suffix because 
          while both spellings are given in the Oxford English Dictionary, only the "-ize" form is used 
          in American English. The following table
          lists the preferred word-spacing and hyphenation for a number of frequently-used terms: <table>

          <item>Similarly, examples often omit text that doesn't serve the purpose of the example.

      <div xml:id="modal-verbs">
        <head>The use of modal verbs</head>
        <p>In general the TEI guidelines try to be careful when using modal verbs and phrases such as 'must', 'must not, 
          'should', 'should not' and 'may'. In terms of the meanings, these generally follow <ref target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14">https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14</ref> in the different meanings of these words.
          In particular:
          <list type="gloss">
            <label>MUST</label>
            <item>This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", mean that this is an absolute requirement of the TEI Guidelines 
              for production of a TEI conformant file.</item>
            <label>MUST NOT</label>
            <item>This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT", mean that this is an absolute prohibition of the 
              TEI Guidelines for produciton of a TEI conformant file.</item>
            <label>SHOULD</label>
            <item>This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there may exist valid reasons in 
              particular circumstances to ignore a particular recommendation, but the full implications 
              must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.</item>
            <label>SHOULD NOT</label>
            <item>This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in 
              particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications 
              should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior so described.</item>
            <label>MAY</label>
            <item>This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that a recommendation is truly optional.  One user may 
            choose to follow the recommendation because a particular project requires it or feels that
            it enhances their work while another project may choose to not follow this recommendation.</item>
          </list>
          Periodic reviews of new prose must be carried out by the TEI Technical Council to ensure the use of modal verbs and phrases is clear.
