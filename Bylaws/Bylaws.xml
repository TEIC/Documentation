         <p>From 2013 to 2023, the Bylaws were maintained in Wordpress which bears traces of the TEI
            header and its changelog from the version of 2013. As of 2023, the version in Wordpress
            was marked, <q>2013 Revision. Edited from online version, last updated 2011-08-09</q>,
            but it was amended in subsequent years, regrettably without a changelog due to the
            Wordpress format. Restoring these Bylaws to TEI format allows for more robust
            preservation of our consortiumâ€™s history and policies, in keeping with the principles of
            the TEI Consortium. In restoring the Bylaws to TEI, elements and structure for this 2023
            edition were chosen in consultation with the 2000 edition in TEI P4 and remnants of the
            changelog visible in the Wordpress encoding. XML comments visible in the Wordpress
            encoding are restored here.</p>
