      <tei-p data-teiname="p">This document aims to provide a set of detailed instructions enabling a "release
        technician" (the Council member tasked with implementing a new release of the TEI) to
        prepare for and manage the release process. It assumes that the new packages will be taken
        from one of the Jenkins servers rather than being built locally by the release technician.
        This is easier and more reliable, because we ensure that the Jenkins servers are regularly
        updated and are correctly configured to build the TEI products.</tei-p>

          and associated schemas is <tei-ref data-teiname="ref" target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI">TEIC/TEI</tei-ref>, and the TEI Stylesheets, the code for
          the Roma web application, and the source code for the Oxygen TEI plugin can be found in

            <tei-ident data-teiname="ident">P5</tei-ident> package, but similar procedures apply to the others. The instructions
          assume you are working on a Linux or MacOSX system with a command line, and know (more or
          less) how to do basic command-line operations such as running scripts and logging into a

            beginning to end takes several hours, especially if something goes a bit wrong and you

            This should be the final push for this version, and it will trigger the Jenkins servers 
            to rebuild the TEI packages. This is where you'll find the Jenkins servers: <tei-list data-teiname="list">
              <tei-item data-teiname="item"><tei-ptr data-teiname="ptr" target="http://jenkins.tei-c.org/"></tei-ptr></tei-item>

            </tei-list> And now you wait while the Jenkins servers build the packages. This can
            take a couple of hours, so be patient. Both of the Jenkins servers should behave
            identically, and they should both build all three TEI packages successfully. 
            <tei-hi data-teiname="hi" rend="bold">Note</tei-hi>: The P5 and Stylesheets builds have reciprocal dependencies,
            so the first build of either the Stylesheets or the Guidelines may fail just because
            there isn't yet a current build of the other for it to use. This isn't a cause for
            panic, but it may mean that (e.g.) the Stylesheets build needs to run twice. In particular,
	    the Stylesheets build may fail after the TEI release is complete, so it is better to wait
	    until the TEI release is complete before doing the Stylesheets release. (Council is considering 
	    changing how the dependency is managed).</tei-item>
