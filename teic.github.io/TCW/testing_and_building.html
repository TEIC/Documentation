        <tei-p data-teiname="p">Getting set up to run the various building and testing targets in the Guidelines and
          Stylesheets is relatively easy in Debian-based Linuxes like Ubuntu. But it is quite tricky on
          other systems, like Mac OS X or Windows. The TEI Jenkins server will run a variety of
          builds when you push changes to the TEI or Stylesheets repos, but you may find you prefer
          to run the tests locally, as they will likely be faster and will save you the trouble of
          waiting for Jenkins to email you when it finds a problem. Moreover, if you’re doing work
          in a branch, Jenkins won’t help you at all, and it can be very useful to “check your work”
          as you go to avoid lots of bug-fixing when your merge back into dev.</tei-p>
        <tei-p data-teiname="p">The first step in setting up your development and testing environment is to get copies of
          the TEI and Stylesheets repositories. These can be obtained from <tei-ptr data-teiname="ptr" target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI"></tei-ptr> and <tei-ptr data-teiname="ptr" target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets"></tei-ptr> respectively. All of the following
          instructions assume you are at least somewhat comfortable working in a command line
          environment. If you aren’t, this would be a good time to learn. A rather Mac-biased
          tutorial may be found at “<tei-ref data-teiname="ref" target="https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial">Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous</tei-ref>”, while Windows 10 users may learn how
          to install a Bash shell and the basics of using it at “<tei-ref data-teiname="ref" target="http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/">How to Install and Use the Linux Bash Shell on Windows 10</tei-ref>”. Once you’re in a
          terminal window, you can clone the TEI repos thus: 
          <tei-lb data-teiname="lb"></tei-lb><tei-code data-teiname="code">git clone git@github.com:TEIC/TEI.git</tei-code> and 
          <tei-lb data-teiname="lb"></tei-lb><tei-code data-teiname="code">git clone git@github.com:TEIC/Stylesheets.git</tei-code>
        </tei-p>
        <tei-p data-teiname="p">It’s probably a good idea to keep these side-by-side. I put mine in a directory called:
            <tei-code data-teiname="code">/Users/hcayless/Development/TEIC</tei-code>. As you will see, it’s a good idea to do
          this somewhere under the Users directory, whether you’re on Mac or Windows. If you’re
          running Ubuntu or some other Linux, you can put them where you like. Let’s assume you’ve
          got working copies of the TEI and Stylesheets repos, and that you’ve made some changes
          you’d like to test before you push them back up to GitHub and make them available to
          everyone. The TEI has set up a pre-built test environment in Docker that you can use.
          First, you should get Docker Community Edition (CE). On a Mac, go to <tei-ptr data-teiname="ptr" target="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/"></tei-ptr>, on Windows, <tei-ptr data-teiname="ptr" target="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/"></tei-ptr>, and on Linux, choose your specific platform here: <tei-ptr data-teiname="ptr" target="https://docs.docker.com/install/"></tei-ptr>. Follow Docker’s “Get Started” instructions for your installation to configure Docker and include the TEI repositories in your Docker container. Once you have Docker
          installed and set up, you can run <tei-lb data-teiname="lb"></tei-lb><tei-code data-teiname="code">docker pull teic/teidev-docker</tei-code>
          <tei-lb data-teiname="lb"></tei-lb>to grab a copy of the pre-built image.</tei-p>
        <tei-p data-teiname="p">Now you’re ready to run your test environment. You’ll need a couple of pieces of
          information for Docker: the location of your repositories and your timezone. You can look up your timezone at <tei-ref data-teiname="ref" target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones">Wikipedia</tei-ref>.
          You need it because the default timezone of the container is UTC, which will lead to
          strange warnings when you run the builds unless you actually happen to be in sync with
          UTC, because the local time of your computer will differ from that set in the container.
          The directory containing your repositories will be mapped to a directory in the container
          (which is why it’s easier to put them side-by-side). You’ll run the test container with a
          command like: 
          <tei-lb data-teiname="lb"></tei-lb><tei-code data-teiname="code">docker run --name tei -v /Users/hcayless/Development/TEIC:/tei -it -e TZ=America/New_York
            teic/teidev-docker</tei-code>
          <tei-lb data-teiname="lb"></tei-lb>which will put you in a Bash shell inside the container (named 'tei'), at the root directory.
          The directory on your local file system where you cloned the TEI and
          Stylesheets repos is mapped to <tei-code data-teiname="code">/tei</tei-code> in the container (that’s the part after
          <tei-code data-teiname="code">-v</tei-code> above). If you then do <tei-code data-teiname="code">cd tei</tei-code> and then <tei-code data-teiname="code">ls</tei-code>, you
          should  see the repos you cloned above. There’s one more piece of work to be done, and
          that’s  to tell the Guidelines build process where it can find your copy of the
          Stylesheets.  You do that by adding a <tei-code data-teiname="code">local.mk</tei-code> file in <tei-code data-teiname="code">TEI/P5</tei-code>.
          So,  (from <tei-code data-teiname="code">/tei</tei-code>) do <tei-code data-teiname="code">cd TEI/P5</tei-code> and then 
          <tei-code data-teiname="code">echo "XSL=/tei/Stylesheets" &gt; local.mk</tei-code>. Now
          you can build things! And, what’s more, you can work on the Guidelines and Stylesheets in
          your regular environment, and test them in Docker. The Docker command above will create a
          container named “tei”, which you can return to later. Because it runs a Bash terminal, you
          can exit it by typing <tei-code data-teiname="code">exit</tei-code> at the command prompt, and that will stop the 
          container. You can restart it with a command like <tei-code data-teiname="code">docker start -ai tei</tei-code>, which
          will start the container and attach your terminal to it, with whatever state it was in
          when you left it. You may want to alias a simple command like <tei-code data-teiname="code">teidocker</tei-code> to 
          <tei-code data-teiname="code">docker start -ai tei</tei-code>.
        </tei-p>
        <tei-p data-teiname="p">To build the HTML version of the Guidelines, for example, you can run (in
            <tei-code data-teiname="code">/tei/TEI/P5</tei-code>) <tei-code data-teiname="code">make html-web</tei-code>, and after the process finishes,
          you’ll have a directory called “Guidelines-web” in your P5 directory. Outside your Docker
          shell, you can browse to this folder, find the index.html file, and open it in a browser.
          “Make” is a program typically used for compiling programs, but it’s also very useful as a 
          kind of generic batch scripting tool, which is how it’s being used here. In the
          Guidelines, you’ll typically want to run Make inside the <tei-code data-teiname="code">P5/</tei-code> directory and in
          the Stylesheets, you’ll want to run it at the top of the repo (in
          <tei-code data-teiname="code">Stylesheets/</tei-code>. You can also run Make in any directory that contains a
          <tei-code data-teiname="code">Makefile</tei-code>. Note that the targets may vary. Running <tei-code data-teiname="code">make</tei-code> inside
          <tei-code data-teiname="code">Stylesheets/Test</tei-code> is pretty much the same as running <tei-code data-teiname="code">make test</tei-code>
          one level up. You can also run individual test targets if there’s a particular set 
          of tests you want to troubleshoot (e.g. <tei-code data-teiname="code">make test-oddity</tei-code> in
          <tei-code data-teiname="code">Stylesheets/Test</tei-code> to test ODD-conversion methods). The targets are all defined
          in the <tei-code data-teiname="code">Makefile</tei-code>s.</tei-p>
        <tei-p data-teiname="p">The <tei-ref data-teiname="ref" target="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/get.xml">Using the TEI GitHub
          Repository</tei-ref> document has more detail on all the processes you can run, and very
          meager information on how to get set up to run them—but you just bypassed all that.
          Besides the <tei-code data-teiname="code">make</tei-code> targets listed there, both the TEI and Stylesheets repos
          have <tei-code data-teiname="code">make test</tei-code> targets which get run by Jenkins when you push to GitHub.
          These are both good ways to check your code before pushing. Make does lots of things when
          you run any of these targets, but all of them should finish with a “BUILD SUCCESSFUL”
          message. If there’s a problem, you’ll get a failure message, hopefully with some
          indication of what went wrong. If you’ve run a build target, you probably want to run a
            <tei-code data-teiname="code">make clean</tei-code> before doing it again to make sure files that were generated
          during the last run don’t interfere with your next build (Make tries not to repeat itself,
          so if it finds existing build artifacts, it won’t rebuild them). Targets can be put
          together, so you can do <tei-code data-teiname="code">make clean test</tei-code>, and it will clean things up before
          running the test target.</tei-p>
        <tei-p data-teiname="p">When you run the tests and other build targets, you’ll see masses of text written out,
          most of which can be ignored. If one of the processes errors out, Make should stop
          running, so the last thing in your terminal should tell you what happened. This may not be
          a very useful message, so you might need to isolate the command that Make ran and run it
          yourself to see the error messages. In the Stylesheets, errors are often in the form of
          differences between the expected output of certain tests and the actual output. Test
          failures here aren’t necessarily errors—if you changed something to do with ODD
          compilation or schema generation, your new output might be correct but different from the
          old. When this happens, you can copy the new output from the <tei-code data-teiname="code">Test/</tei-code> directory
          into <tei-code data-teiname="code">Test/expected-results</tei-code>. You’ll want to be a bit careful that your new
          output is actually correct, of course, because now the test will pass even if it’s not
          really working, because all it’s checking is whether the test output is the same as what
          it expects.</tei-p>
        <tei-p data-teiname="p">Good luck and happy testing!</tei-p>
